## Note
A forewarning, I am very new to electronics design in general I apologies in advance for any really baffeling design desisions. I hope to learn using these projects and will keep them updated as I learn more. Thank you for your patience.

# FrameWork
FrameWork is intended to be a open source bundle of different hardware periferals built around (but not always exclusive to) the steam frame. The idea is to leverage the steam frames modularity and general open nature to create a collection of open source hardware projects that the community can give feeback to, expand upon, or even take and make somthing entirly new creating a feedback loop to add to an ever expanding ecosystem for the steam frame. All source files will be included from PCB schmatics to STLs allowing every aspect of each project to be modified and then produced to anyones preferences.

## Hardware


### Frame Facetracker


### Versipellis (General Purpose Dongle)


### Locus (Tracker)
