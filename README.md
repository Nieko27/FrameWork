## Note
A forewarning, I am very new to electronics design in general I apologize in advance for any really baffling design decisions. I hope to learn using these projects and will keep them updated as I learn more. Thank you for your patience.

# What is FrameWork?
FrameWork is intended to be a open source bundle of different hardware peripherals built around (but not always exclusive to) the steam frame. The idea is to leverage the steam frames modularity and general open nature to create a collection of open source hardware projects that the community can give feedback to, expand upon, or even take and make something entirely new creating a feedback loop to add to an ever expanding ecosystem for the steam frame. All source files will be included from PCB schematics to STLs allowing every aspect of each project to be modified and then produced to anyone’s preferences. 

## Hardware


### Frame Facetracker


### Versipellis (General Purpose Dongle)


### Locus (Tracker)
